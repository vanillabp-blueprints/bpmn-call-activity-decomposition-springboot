/**
 * The integration test of this workflow module: it starts a real workflow in a real BPMS
 * and waits for the process to have done its work - across the call activity, which is the
 * aspect of this blueprint.
 *
 * <p>
 * The test knows one process. It starts the loan approval and waits for the decision, and
 * the risk assessment shows up in it only as the two attributes the called process wrote.
 * That is what a decomposition is supposed to look like from the outside, and it is why a
 * test written against the aggregate survives the model being split up differently
 * tomorrow.
