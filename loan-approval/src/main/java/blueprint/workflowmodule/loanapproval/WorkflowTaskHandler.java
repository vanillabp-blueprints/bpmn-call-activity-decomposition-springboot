/**
 * What the processes tell the application: the incoming half of the BPMN wiring.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a driving adapter, the same kind of thing as {@link ApiController}: something
 * outside triggers, and the trigger is translated into a call to {@link Service}. That the
 * caller is a BPMS rather than a browser changes nothing about the direction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Two processes, one handler, one aggregate.</strong> {@code loan_approval} is the
 * process the application starts, {@code risk_assessment} is the one its call activity
 * calls, and {@code secondaryBpmnProcesses} is what tells VanillaBP that the tasks of both
 * belong to this class and work on the same workflow aggregate. That is what decomposition
 * means: the model was split to stay readable, the business case was not.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Declare every called process here rather than in a handler class of its own. VanillaBP
 * builds one {@code ProcessService} per workflow aggregate class, and the process it
 * starts is the one of the first workflow service class it happens to find - with a second
 * class on the same aggregate, {@code startWorkflow} may start the called process instead
 * of the calling one, and nothing says so. A called process with an aggregate of its own is
 * a different situation altogether; the README says what VanillaBP does with that one.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>The call activity has no method here, and needs none.</strong> A call activity is
 * executed by the BPMS itself: it starts the called process and waits for it. There is
 * nothing for the application to do, which is why a model can be split without a line of
 * code changing.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There is no {@code @Transactional} here, and adding one would be a mistake. VanillaBP
 * loads the aggregate, runs the method and saves the aggregate in one transaction it owns,
 * and it commits that transaction for a {@code TaskException} on purpose. A transaction
 * declared by the application would roll back instead and throw away what the handler
 * wrote for the process to react to. VanillaBP does not let that happen unnoticed: such an
 * annotation on this class or on a {@code @WorkflowTask} method fails the boot naming the
 * method, and one on a bean further down the call chain fails the task while it runs.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/vanillabp/spi-for-java#call-activities">Call
 *      activities</a>
